### Python software for visual stimulation of infants

This repo is the container for Python software used for visual stimulation of infants.
This software was developed in the framework of Project MoViS, an academic effort funded by a European Research Counsil - Proof of Concept grant (ERC-PoC).

The code makes use of PsychoPy (https://www.psychopy.org/), a cross-platform package useful to create precise audio-visual stimulation with a pc.
